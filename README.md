Welcome to the <strong>HackerRank Solutions</strong> repository ! This repository contains solutions to various programming problems that I have solved on HackerRank, organized by domains such as programming language, problem-solving, and more, similar to the structure on the HackerRank site. The aim is to provide clean, efficient, and well-documented solutions to give clear insights into my problem-solving approaches in various domains and programming languages.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/Domain Name :** Contains directories for each problem category (e.g., Algorithms, Data Structures, Mathematics, Python, C, Ruby, etc).
   - ‚Ü≥ **/solution files :** Contains Solution code with solutions to specific problems, named in sequential order indexed according to the problem title as given on the HackerRank site. Each Solution file contains its Problem link commented on the top of the solution code<br>
   - ‚Ü≥ **/Readme File :** Contains additional information including description of the directory, usage of the solution files with explanations.

Below is a Exemplar visual representation of the Repository Structure :  

>- **HackerRank/**  (Parent Directory)
>  - **Ruby/**  (Subdirectory for Ruby solutions)
>    - `1.rb`  # Solution for problem 1
>    - `2.rb`  # Solution for problem 2
>    - `3.rb`  # Solution for problem 3
>  - **Python/**  (Subdirectory for Python solutions)
>    - `1.py`  # Solution for problem 1
>    - `2.py`  # Solution for problem 2
>    - `3.py`  # Solution for problem 3
>  - **Problem_Solving/**  (Subdirectory for problem-solving challenges)
>    - `1_problem_solving.c`  # Solution for problem solving challenge 1
>    - `2_problem_solving.py`  # Solution for problem solving challenge 2
>    - `3_problem_solving.java`  # Solution for problem solving challenge 3

### Summary

This structure provides a clear overview of how solutions are organized by programming language and problem type, making it easy for users to navigate and understand the repository's content.
